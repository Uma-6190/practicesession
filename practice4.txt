Git Add
The git add command adds new or changed files in your working directory to the Git staging area.

git add is an important command - without it, no git commit would ever do anything. Sometimes, git add can have a 
reputation for being an unnecessary step in development. But in reality, git add is an important and powerful tool. git 
add allows you to shape history without changing how you work.

When do you use git add?
git add README.md
As you're working, you change and save a file, or multiple files. Then, before you commit, you must git add. This step 
allows you to choose what you are going to commit. Commits should be logical, atomic units of change - but not everyone 
works that way. Maybe you are making changes to files that aren't logical or atomic units of change. git add allows you 
to systematically shape your commits and your history anyway.
